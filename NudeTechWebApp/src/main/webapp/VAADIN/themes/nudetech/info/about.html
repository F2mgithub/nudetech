        <p>
            NUDEtech is a tool for automatically detecting nudity of an uploaded image or video. 
            Through the advance technologies and algorithms in computer vision, it is possible to
            determine if a certain video or image is pornographic or contains nudity.

        This is a prototype system, and this tool can be integrated with various file and media 
        sharing sites such as Youtube, Flickr, Rapidshare, Megaupload etc to prevent images/videos
        containing nudity or pornography from being uploaded to their system.
